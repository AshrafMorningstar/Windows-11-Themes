/* global module, require -- required for CJS file */

// Jest (and probably some other runtimes with custom implementations of
// `require`) doesn't support `exports` in `package.json`, so this file is here
// to help them load this module. Note that it is also `.js` and not `.cjs` for
// the same reason - `cjs` files requires to be loaded with an extension, but
// since Jest doesn't respect `module` outside of ESM mode it still works in
// this case (and the `require` in _this_ file does specify the extension).

module.exports = require("./dist/eslintrc-universal.cjs");
