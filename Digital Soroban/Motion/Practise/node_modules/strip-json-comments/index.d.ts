Strip comments from JSON. Lets you use comments in your JSON files!

It will replace single-line comments `//` and multi-line comments `/**\/` with whitespace. This allows JSON error positions to remain as close as possible to the original source.

@param jsonString - Accepts a string with JSON.
@returns A JSON string without comments.

@example
```
const json = `{
	// Rainbows
	"unicorn": "cake"
}`;

JSON.parse(stripJsonComments(json));
//=> {unicorn: 'cake'}
```
