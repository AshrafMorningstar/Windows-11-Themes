ESLint couldn't find the plugin "${pluginName}".

(The package "${pluginName}" was not found when loaded as a Node module from the directory "${resolvePluginsRelativeTo}".)

It's likely that the plugin isn't installed correctly. Try reinstalling by running the following:

    npm install ${pluginName}@latest --save-dev

The plugin "${pluginName}" was referenced from the config file in "${importerName}".

If you still can't figure out the problem, please see https://eslint.org/docs/latest/use/troubleshooting.
