To create both files and folders in a project structure like the one you've described (`/project-folder`, `/assets`, `/css`, `/js`, and HTML files) with just one click in Windows, you can create a simple batch script. This script will automate the process of creating the necessary folders and files.

Here’s how you can do it:

### Step 1: Create the Batch Script

1. Open **Notepad**.

2. Copy and paste the following code into Notepad. This script will create the directory structure and the files you've listed.

    ```batch
    @echo off

    REM Create project folder structure
    mkdir "project-folder\assets\css"
    mkdir "project-folder\assets\js"

    REM Create HTML files in the project folder
    echo. > "project-folder\index.html"
    echo. > "project-folder\about.html"
    echo. > "project-folder\clock.html"
    echo. > "project-folder\date-time.html"
    echo. > "project-folder\youtube.html"
    echo. > "project-folder\google-search.html"

    REM Create CSS and JS files
    echo. > "project-folder\assets\css\styles.css"
    echo. > "project-folder\assets\js\script.js"

    echo All folders and files created!
    pause
    ```

3. **Save the File**: 
   - In Notepad, go to **File > Save As**.
   - Set the **Save as type** to **All Files**.
   - Name the file `create_project_structure.bat`.
   - Save it anywhere on your computer, but remember where you saved it.

### Step 2: Run the Script

1. **Double-click** the `create_project_structure.bat` file you just created.
   
2. The script will automatically create the folder structure (`/project-folder`, `/assets`, `/css`, `/js`) and the files (`index.html`, `about.html`, etc.) in the specified locations.

### What the Script Does

- It creates the folder structure, including:
  - `project-folder`
  - `assets`
    - `css`
    - `js`
  
- It creates the following files in the appropriate locations:
  - `index.html`
  - `about.html`
  - `clock.html`
  - `date-time.html`
  - `youtube.html`
  - `google-search.html`
  - `styles.css` (inside `assets/css`)
  - `script.js` (inside `assets/js`)

### Customizing the Script

- If you need to modify the folder names or add more files, just adjust the `mkdir` (for folders) and `echo.` (for files) commands in the batch script.
