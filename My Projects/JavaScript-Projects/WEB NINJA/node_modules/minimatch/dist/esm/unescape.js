/**
 * Un-escape a string that has been escaped with {@link escape}.
 *
 * If the {@link windowsPathsNoEscape} option is used, then square-brace
 * escapes are removed, but not backslash escapes.  For example, it will turn
 * the string `'[*]'` into `*`, but it will not turn `'\\*'` into `'*'`,
 * becuase `\` is a path separator in `windowsPathsNoEscape` mode.
 *
 * When `windowsPathsNoEscape` is not set, then both brace escapes and
 * backslash escapes are removed.
 *
 * Slashes (and backslashes in `windowsPathsNoEscape` mode) cannot be escaped
 * or unescaped.
