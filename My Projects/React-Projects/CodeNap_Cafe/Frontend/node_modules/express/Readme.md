```

## Installation

This is a [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) module available through the

Before installing, [download and install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
Node.js 18 or higher is required.

If this is a brand new project, make sure to create a `package.json` first with
the [`npm init` command](https://docs.npmjs.com/creating-a-package-json-file).

Installation is done using the
[`npm install` command](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-npm-packages-locally):

```bash
npm install express
```

Follow [our installing guide](https://expressjs.com/en/starter/installing.html)
for more information.

## Docs & Community

  * [Website and Documentation](https://expressjs.com/) - [[website repo](https://github.com/AshrafMorningstar
  * [GitHub Organization](https://github.com/AshrafMorningstar for Official Middleware & Modules
  * [Github Discussions](https://github.com/AshrafMorningstar for discussion on the development and usage of Express

**PROTIP** Be sure to read the [migration guide to v5](https://expressjs.com/en/guide/migrating-5)

## Quick Start

  The quickest way to get started with express is to utilize the executable [`express(1)`](https://github.com/AshrafMorningstar to generate an application as shown below:

  Install the executable. The executable's major version will match Express's:

```bash
npm install -g express-generator@4
```

  Create the app:

```bash
express /tmp/foo && cd /tmp/foo
```

  Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

  Start the server:

```bash
npm start
```

  View the website at: http://localhost:3000

## Philosophy

  The Express philosophy is to provide small, robust tooling for HTTP servers, making
  it a great solution for single page applications, websites, hybrids, or public
  HTTP APIs.

  Express does not force you to use any specific ORM or template engine. With support for over
  14 template engines via [@ladjs/consolidate](https://github.com/AshrafMorningstar
  you can quickly craft your perfect framework.

## Examples

  To view the examples, clone the Express repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AshrafMorningstar --depth 1 && cd express
```

  Then install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

  Then run whichever example you want:

```bash
node examples/content-negotiation
```
